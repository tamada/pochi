## :question: Icon of pochi

{{< image src="images/pochi.png" width="128" class="avatar" />}}

This dog logo is the craft by folding the paper (ORIGAMI).
Folding procedure is shown in [Genuine Origami](https://www.amazon.com/dp/4889962514).

In Japan, **pochi** is a familiar name for dogs. :dog:
The project name is based on the famous phrase in the tale of "[The Man who made flowers bloom](http://hukumusume.com/douwa/English/jap/05/01_j&E.html)." :cherry_blossom:
The phrase is "dig here, bow-wow" by the pet dog of the man to detect the treasure. :gift:
The birthmark toolkit will find objects from a lot of programs.
Hence, I associate the project and the dog name; then, the project name becomes **pochi**.

However, the correct name of the dog in the tale was SHIRO. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
